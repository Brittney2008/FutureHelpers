        <p>
            The mission of Future Helpers is to connect young volunteers (18 and under) with meaningful 
            volunteer opportunities that match their interests and abilities. By providing access to local 
            and virtual activities, our platform helps young people become active participants in their 
            communities while ensuring their safety and growth.
            
            Our platform is easy to use, with tools like filters to find activities that match your location, 
            interests, and availability. Whether you're passionate about environmental causes, helping the 
            elderly, or contributing through online tutoring, there's something here for everyone.
