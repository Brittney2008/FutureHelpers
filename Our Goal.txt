        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>
            The mission of Future Helpers is to connect young volunteers (18 and under) with meaningful 
            volunteer opportunities that match their interests and abilities. By providing access to local 
            and virtual activities, our platform helps young people become active participants in their 
            communities while ensuring their safety and growth.
        </p>
